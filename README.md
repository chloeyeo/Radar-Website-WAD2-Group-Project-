# WAD2-Project

Website URL: https://radar1.pythonanywhere.com/

University of Glasgow Bsc Computing Science (4 Years) End of Year 2 (end of second term) WAD2 course group project.

As our group project, we created a website called Radar using Python Django framework, HTML, JavaScript and HTML.

Radar is a website where you can visit various fantasy places/buildings by category

(you can view and select each category by clicking the hamburger menu button on the top left)

such as buildings that appear in cartoons, anime, movies or video games.

All users can view posts and search posts by their titles, and they can still see the like button
and the number of likes as well as the number of views whether logged in or not.

The number of views of a post goes up once any user clicks on the post and views its content,
which is a description of what that place/building is about, how it is known in the movie/anime/etc
that it appears in, and so on.

Posts of fantasy places/buildings are sorted in the ascending order by the number of likes.

Users can signup or login, and only the authenticated users can click the like button of posts,
and can also upload their own posts of fantasy building/places under a chosen media category that
the building appeared in.

When signing up, users can also upload their profile photo.

Once users sign up, they are asked to go to the login page with the corresponding url displayed on screen.

Once logged in, the login and signup buttons on the top right disappears and is replaced with
the profile picture of user account (or a grey person photo if none is provided). When this is clicked,
the user will see three options to click: 'Add post', 'Account', and 'Sign out'; meaning that the
user can now add their own posts, view their accounts or sign out correspondingly.

When authenticated users view and click 'Account', the user can view their profile picture,
username and email which they can reset and save.

When authenticated users view and click 'Add post', they can add a photo for the post which may be of the building;
write description for the building/place the post describes in the box for 'Place description'; add the title
of the post which may be the name of the building; and choose the category under which the building in the post
belongs to, all before finally clicking the 'Submit' button and uploading the post.
